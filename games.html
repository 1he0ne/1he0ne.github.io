      <h1>>> Forge Squad</h1>
      <p>During my Master's in Game Development and Simulation, my team - "Wizard Dudes" - won the Best in Class Award in 2020 for Forge Squad, a game we developed using Unreal Engine 4. I was the team leader and music/SFX lead, and wrote the logic for many of the game's crafting-related elements and tools. I also contributed to enemy wave generation scripts, spawning logic, and large-scale refactoring. Together, we made the game ready for release, and published it on Steam.</p>

      <h1>>> Lunatrix</h1>
      <p>After the success of Forge Squad, my team and I participated in the 48 hour Global Game Jam 2022 and created Lunatrix, a game based on the theme "Duality" that challenges players to defend a growing base from attacking spaceships. I designed the building grid system and the algorithm to rotate tetris-style modular base expansions and combine them into groups that merged together similar buildings as they were added to the base.</p>

      <h1>>> More games!</h1>
      <p>Throughout my career, I have developed a variety of solo projects under tight time constraints, ranging from 48 to 72 hours, such as the following: <br />
        <br />
        <b>"Soul Eater"</b> (Ludum Dare) is a story-based, ASCII-only, turn-based RPG that incorporates strategic decision-making in balancing character stamina and HP by consuming the soul energy of defeated enemies or items. Stronger enemies could call for help, adding complexity to the game. <br />
        <br />
        <b>"Ballistix"</b> (LD 27) is a physics-based catapult game that challenges players to feed vegetarian plants with their desired fruit and sell well-fed plants for a profit. The soundtrack is randomly generated from song fragments I created to fit together, resulting in a looping music experience with many possible combinations. <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/Edolin/ballistix?acomplete=ballistix">

        </a>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>"Solar System Hero"</b> (LD 30) requires players to establish trade routes between planets orbiting a sun. Each planet's layout indicates demand/surplus of resources, and automated ships must be sent to collect and drop off specific resources. Buildings on each planet provide additional demand and surplus resources. <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/Edolin/solar-system-hero?acomplete=solar+system+hero">

        </a>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>"CPU Fight"</b> (high-school) allows combatants to add and upgrade PC parts and use "hacking" commands to annoy and kick out adversaries from the game. <br />
        <br /> The list goes on with various genres, including 3-lane-runner-with-fire-extinguisher, top-down-2d-shooter-with-mining-and-3d-rendered-models, turn-based-time-travel-mystery, racing and jump 'n' run.

      <h1>>> Humble beginnings</h1>
      <p>Ever since I played video games, I wanted to know how to make them. Without having access to internet at an early age, I gave up for a while, after the built-in BASIC tutorial of my dad's x286 laptop told me to use "PRINT", but that button labeled "Print Scn" just wouldn't execute the command. <br />
        <br /> In highschool, I finally had internet access. I would deliberately stay in school longer to learn more about ActionScript 3, the only language I was taught at the time. When our professor challenged us to write a Flash game within 2 hours, where we had to draw a crosshair, and increment the score on each clicked target that would then randomly jump to a different location on screen - I proudly presented my solution after 10 minutes and was allowed to teach the class for the rest of the day and help them complete their projects. <br />
        <br /> That's when I resumed my plan from primary school; I knew what I wanted to be doing for my life - "something with computers". Years later, I ended up as a software engineer, but I kept writing games and music ever since.
