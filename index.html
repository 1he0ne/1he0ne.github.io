      <h1>>> Tech-enthusiast</h1>
      <p>I am deeply enthusiastic about technology due to the limitless possibilities it offers. Computers are incredible tools that can be leveraged in countless ways, and I am particularly drawn to the ability to transform ideas and concepts into tangible reality through technology.</p>
      <h1>>> Musician</h1>
      <p>With over 400 tracks released so far, including OSTs, music packs, EPs, and entire albums, I excel in chiptune, EDM-style synth compositions, and orchestral music. I also love using retro soundfonts to compose music in the style of N64, PS2, and others. <br />
        <br /> I have been playing the clarinet since my permanent teeth were able to hold the mouthpiece. I have composed various pieces of music, including duos for the clarinet and scores for my hometown's orchestra where I play first desk Bb clarinet and Eb for extra color. <br />
        <br /> During my musical journey, I also collaborated with other composers on VGM projects, like <u>Harvey Carman</u>, <u>Jeff Heim</u> and <u>GerCR</u>, playing to our strengths.
      </p>
      <h1>>> Programmer &amp; Inventor</h1>
      <p>I use my programming skills to build audio plugins (VST) with C++ and the open-source iPlug2 Framework, allowing me to shape sounds and music precisely to my liking. My passion for making things easier and more efficient has also led me to repair numerous items using 3D printing techniques. I have also created a light-sensitive hardware synthesizer, and a kitchen timer with configurable melodies using Arduino microcontrollers. Furthermore, I have programmed LCD matrix games with the same chipset and all its limitations, such as a two-player co-op airplane vs. dinosaur shooter and classics like Pong. </p>
      <h1>>> Gamer</h1>
      <p>I thrive on challenges, which is why I enjoy playing games on hard mode. Whether I'm strategizing in Age of Empires II, Into the Breach and Stellaris, or engaging in intense shooter battles in Overwatch 2, Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands, I love the rush of pushing myself to the limit. As much as I enjoy the challenge of games, I also have a deep appreciation for their soundtracks. Before streaming was a thing, I often found myself starting up games just to listen to the music, even if I didn't have time to play.</p>
